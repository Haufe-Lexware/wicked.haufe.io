    p.
      In order to get your API portal up and running, you need to configure a couple of things.
      Pages with a red exclamation mark (<span style='color:red' class='glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign'></span>) 
      definitely need attention. Those with yellow ones should also be looked into, and the others
      can be changed when there is need for it.
